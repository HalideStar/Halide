/** \mainpage Halide
 *
 * Introductory documentation and tutorials are coming shortly. For now
 * look in the test folder for many small examples that use halide's
 * jit-compilation functionality, and look in the apps folder for
 * larger examples that statically compile halide pipelines. 
 *
 * Below are links to the documentation for the important classes in Halide.
 *
 * For defining, scheduling, and evaluating basic pipelines:
 *
 * Halide::Func, Halide::Var
 * 
 * Our image data type:
 *
 * Halide::Image
 * 
 * For passing around and reusing halide expressions:
 * 
 * Halide::Expr
 * 
 * For representing scalar and image parameters to pipelines:
 *
 * Halide::Param, Halide::ImageParam
 *
 * For writing functions that reduce or scatter over some domain:
 *
 * Halide::RDom
 *
